> The on-stream graphics to be used during RPG Limit Break 2019.

This is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) v1 bundle. You will need to have NodeCG v1 installed to run it.

## Note from RPG Limit Break
This bundle is based on the open source codebase for the [AGDQ 2019 layouts](https://github.com/GamesDoneQuick/agdq19-layouts), made available by [Support Class](https://supportclass.net/). We are very grateful to their team for their generous contributions which have significantly improved the quality of our events for 5 years running.

Although this bundle is offered under the same license terms, no special effort has been made for it to be easily modifiable or usable as a learning tool. *You should not use this bundle verbatim in any case.* If you are looking to learn or build your own similar stream graphics, we recommend looking at the AGDQ 2019 bundle from which this bundle was forked.
